# History

The Mumsys project

MUMSYS stands for Multi User Managment System. Altn. "Mother System" (c) 2002 - 2016, now

In that time an admin CMS system to:

    Create admin pages for new buissness tasks,
    Huge lists of data
    Handling processes on the server side for audio and video tasks
    Shop related admin tasks and inventory control because then it was mostly used for a music distribution.

The Cms, Library and Programs are new parts of the single project. 
A rework beginning in that time and now going to be free!

Parts of the Mumsys project:
    Cms: The Cms part is a skeleton for an application to be used in shell or web enviroment.
    Programs: The Programs are our applications to be used inside the cms.
    Library: The components to be used to make this work

If you like it, use it, feel free to contribute :-)
